## Plan:

0. Basic EDA for getting situated
1. Import data and generate new features. 
- Generate features
2. Clean data
- One hot object variables
- One hot numeric variables that should be categorical
- Fill NA with -1
3. XGB model implementation and prediction submission

To add 
1. Implement linReg, and neural network models. Ensemble and submit.
2. Add other data sources? Will be allowed after first round, I think.
